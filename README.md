Using Excel to create an interactive dashboard 
Introduction 
Cars have been reinvented each year over the years. It is one of the fastest-growing industries and it is very important in our day-to-day activity for mobility. No matter the model of any car it is still valuable. According to Wikipedia about one billion cars have been sold and are in use worldwide.
This automobile outlet has been selling cars, motorcycles, trucks, ships, and trains across Europe and America
The aim of this project is to drive insight into sales over the three years period and look at areas of improvement. Excel was the analytical software used in the analysis of the project. 
Data collection, data cleaning, modelling and visualization are the processes used in this analysis. Pivot tables were used to explore the dataset to get our visualization using charts. Slicers were created to build an interactive dashboard.
Data Processes
This dataset contains the order number, quantity ordered, price each, sales, order date, status, product line, customer name, city, postal code, and country. The processes are as follows:
1.	Data collection: the dataset was collected from Kaggle. It was downloaded as a zip file into the computer. It was extracted and loaded into Excel.   
2.	Data Cleaning: the dataset was put in a table for  easier analysis. All blank columns were removed because it was greater than 30%. Then other blank columns that the blanks were less than 30% were replaced with the recurring value. All duplicates were removed and the data types were changed in accordance with the dataset.        
    
3.	Exploratory data analysis: the dataset was explored using a pivot table
   
As we can see in the image above, we have lots of pivot tables, and all the variables were compared with each other. This helps to view the analysis from all angles before extracting the important value.

4.	Visualization: using the right chart to express your data is very important. For this dataset column chart was used to analyze the sales by country, product sales, and monthly sales. 
  

Interpretation
According to the sales by country chart Denmark, Switzerland, Sweden, Austria and Singapore performed well over the three years period.
